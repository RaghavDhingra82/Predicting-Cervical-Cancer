# Predicting-Cervical-Cancer
Predicting cervical cancer involves various factors, including medical history, lifestyle factors, and genetic predispositions. However, one of the most critical elements in predicting cervical cancer is regular screening using Pap smears or HPV tests. These screenings can detect abnormal cells or the presence of the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a significant risk factor for cervical cancer.
